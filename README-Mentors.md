# Rainier Athletes Mentor Portal

## Mentor Instructions:
Rainier Athletes will set up an account for you, based on your assigned Gmail account. If you do not have an account with Rainier Athletes, please contact Rainier Athletes to add you as a verified user.

Sign into your account from the home page: Click the "Sign in with Google" button on the upper righthand side of the navigation bar. This will bring you to a prompt to verify your Google account. Once you've signed in, you will then see the Mentor Dashboard. 

### How to Create a New Synopsis Report:

1. Once you are logged in, you will see the Point Tracker form . This will take the inputs you enter from your student's weekly point sheet.

2. Find your student from the dropdown list. Choose a date from the calendar. Click **Create New Report**.

3. Working with your student, tally the stamps, eXes, and any missed days for each subject/period. The form will calculate the totals for each, and determine the amount of playing time the student has earned.

  3a. As a mentor, you have the ability to "override" the amount of playing time assigned to the student. If you have had a discussion with the student about their performance and agreed on a plan for improvement, you can either assign more/less playing time based on your discussion. 

  **Insert screen shot of override option with text area for comments**

4. Please provide a write-up for your Synopsis, entering details about Student Action Items, Sports Update, Additional Comments, and Playing Time Earned.

5. Once the necessary information has been entered, click the Preview button.

6. Your form will reset upon Submit. If you are meeting with another student, start the process again.

7. Logout.
