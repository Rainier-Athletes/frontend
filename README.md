3. Tally the stamps, x's, and any missed days for each subject/period. The form will calculate the totals for each, and determine the amount of playing time the student has earned.

  3a. As a mentor, you have the ability to "override" the amount of playing time assigned to the student. If you have had a discussion with the student about their performance, and agreed on a plan for improvement, you can either assign more/less playing time based on your discussion. 

  **Insert screen shot of override option with text area for comments**

4. Once the necessary information has been entered, click the preview button.

5. A preview of the report will pop up. If you are satisfied and do not need to make edits, hit submit. This will send the report to Rainier Athletes and the student's guardians. This will also inform the coach of the amount of playing time the student has earned.
