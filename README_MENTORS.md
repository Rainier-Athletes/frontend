# RAINIER ATHLETES MENTOR PORTAL

## Mentor Instructions:
Rainier Athletes will set up an account for you, based on your assigned Gmail account. If you do not have an account with Rainier Athletes, please contact Rainier Athletes to add you as a verified user.

### How to Create a New Point Tracker and Synopsis Report for a Student:

1. Choose a Student from the dropdown list in the sidebar. If you are mentoring one Student, this will be the only name you see. 

Once a Student has been selected, the main content area will populate with that Student's profile, including the Student's contact information, current sports, and family contact information. Please familiarize yourself with this information for ease of navigation.

*For the purpose of these instructions, the student is a mock-up and not an actual person.

2. Below the basic Student information (birthdate, current school, and contact phone and email) are three buttons, which allow you to navigate to the reference documents for each student.
- Synopsis Report Archive: a folder containing previous reports for the Student
- Student Documents: additional documents relating to the Student, as a Google Drive folder
- Student Calendar: the Student's primary Sports or Activity calendar

3. Click **Point Tracker** in the right hand corner of the main content area. A window will pop-up to allow you to create a new Point Tracker for your student.

4. Choose the time period for the new tracker.

5. Select how you communicated with the Student's team during the week. The Communication Touch Points include via Face-to-face, Digital (email/text?), Phone, or Other. If you select Other, a drop-down box will appear; please provide an explanation.

**Other dropdown**

6. How did you meet with your Student's team? Select from the One Team Face-to-Face Meet-ups options.

7. Provide additional information in the One Team Notes section. 

8. Working with your Student, how much of their Point Sheet is complete? If it is greater than 25% complete, select Yes. If less than 25% complete, select No. You now have options for reporting whether the Point Sheet is lost, incomplete, the Student was absent during the week, or something else happened to the Point Sheet. Please explain in the Notes section.

9. From the Student's Point Sheet, tally the stamps, eXes, and any missed days for each subject/period. The form will calculate the totals for each, and determine the amount of playing time the student has earned.

  9a. As a mentor, you have the ability to "override" the amount of playing time assigned to the student by the calculations. If you have had a discussion with the student about their performance, you can either assign more or less playing time based on your discussion and whether you have worked together to create a plan for improvement.

  **Insert screen shot of override option with text area for comments**

10. Please provide a write-up for your Synopsis, entering details about Student Action Items, Sports Update, and Additional Comments.

11. Once the necessary information has been entered, click Submit Point Tracker.

  12. A Summary of your report will pop up. Select the Copy to Clipboard button on the bottom left. This will select the Summary information and allow you to copy this to your Student's Coach/es in Basecamp.

13. After you've done that, click the Link to Point Tracker, which will generate your Synopsis Report and send it to Rainier Athletes and the student's team. This will also inform the coach of the amount of playing time the student has earned.

14. Close the window. If you are meeting with another student, start the process again.

15. Logout.
